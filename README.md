# Recipe Robber
Recipe Robber is a .Net Web MVC that is meant to catch the appeal of people that are interested in the foods that they have seen on their favorite shows,movies, or restaurants.
This application allows them to post their own copycat recipes, as well as view all recipes and leave comments and ratings on each recipe.

Updating frontend responsibilites 
to reach full potential but I encourage whomever to clone this repository to Visual Studio or access the link from Azure https://reciperobbermvc.azurewebsites.net/ !
